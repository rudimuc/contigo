# introduction

In the past I have used many management apps for my videos and images. Unfortunately they reached end of life or the maintainer switched to an expensive cloud/subscription license.

Some years ago I started to develop my own media library. It began as a small part of software for displaying videos and images. It became larger and larger. As it was "only for me" it included some quick and dirty hacks, only few testing code and an architecture that was not maintainable any more. Or only with a lot of effort...

# roadmap

Hopefully (if I have enough time) the first version will be provided in 2025 and will include
- user management
- handling images
- handling videos
- handling 3d objects 
- a world map with all your locations
- face and person recognition
- "like" functionality
- intelligent albums (search funtion with logical operators)

# dependencies
- AdminKit (Basic Layout)
- Leaflet (Maps)

# about the name

Maybe you are asking yourself: `What does that name mean?`

"Contigo" is spanish and means "with you". That is the main principle of this piece of software.
It has the claim to be "with you". To be up to date. To offer you more than the big tech companies.

So, at least for me Contigo will be my "partner in crime" and will support me with cool features, that I even don't get from the big tech companies.
I hope you will enjoy it as well.
